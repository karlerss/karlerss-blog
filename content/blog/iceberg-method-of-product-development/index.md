[RecruitLab](https://recruitlab.co.uk) applicant tracking software had its one-year birthday on February 1st 2021. Thank you, Paavo and Marie!

I remember a phrase from a user interview in Feb 2020 - from a recruitment agency manager about recruiters: "details make their head hurt". Being hard to use and having a steep learning curve are common complaints (and thus fears) about applicant tracking systems (and maybe business software in general).

No problem - if users don't want complex software, let's only build simple software.

Uh-oh!

They still have pretty complex needs.

For me, the way around this contradiction has been what I call the Iceberg Method. Of course, I stole the name:

> The [iceberg theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_theory) or theory of omission is a writing technique coined by American writer Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.

I've been trying to apply this principle to building software products - to only show the top 10% and "hide" everything that could distract the user from the most useful features. This should ease the learning curve so that getting the initial value out of our product is a matter of minutes.

An obvious downside of this approach is the reduced discoverability of advanced features. If you hide it, they won't find it. I imagine the solution is to use consistent UI patterns to indicate that there's always more to it. To establish the implication of "deeper ~~meaning~~ features". This way, if the user discovers a feature once, they learn to discover features in other places.

This style could be followed recursively - once an advanced flow is started, it should still look relatively simple on the surface. We can achieve this with sensible defaults and well-worded tooltips.

P.S. Riffing on icebergs - I hope that our radical strive for surface simplicity will pierce some hulls of incumbent titanics - of course providing clients safety on our charming iceberg.
